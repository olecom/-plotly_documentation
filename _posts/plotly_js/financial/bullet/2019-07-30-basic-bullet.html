  Stephen Few's Bullet Chart was invented to replace dashboard [gauges](https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/) and meters, combining both types of charts into simple bar charts with qualitative bars (steps), quantitative bar (bar) and performance line (threshold); all into one simple layout.
  Steps typically are broken into several values, which are defined with an array. The bar represent the actual value that a particular variable reached, and the threshold usually indicate a goal point relative to the value achieved by the bar. See [indicator page](https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/) for more detail.
