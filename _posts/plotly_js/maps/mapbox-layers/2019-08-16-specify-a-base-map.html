    If you have access to your own private tile servers, or wish to use a tile server not included in the list above, the recommended approach is to set layout.mapbox.style to "white-bg" and to use layout.mapbox.layers with below to specify a custom base map.
    If you omit the below attribute when using this approach, your data will likely be hidden by fully-opaque raster tiles!
